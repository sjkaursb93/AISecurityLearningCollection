# AI Agents Security

This folder contains resources, frameworks, and best practices specifically focused on securing AI agents and autonomous systems. AI agents present unique security challenges due to their autonomous decision-making capabilities, multi-step reasoning, and ability to interact with external systems and APIs.

## Why AI Agent Security Matters

AI agents operate with varying degrees of autonomy and can:
- Make decisions that affect critical business processes
- Access sensitive data and systems
- Interact with external services on behalf of users
- Execute actions in real-world environments
- Learn and adapt their behavior over time

These capabilities require specialized security considerations beyond traditional AI model security.
